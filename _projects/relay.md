Relay is a high level intermediate representation for the TVM framework. The goal of Relay
is to replace old computation graph based IRs such as NNVM with a more expressive IR
that can be effectively optimized for many targets.

Relay is still in active research and development, but you can find the initial
[alpha version](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/1673) in TVM's master branch.

Look forward to more documentation and papers in the coming weeks and months.

For now you can read our [workshop paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00952) from
earlier in the year.
